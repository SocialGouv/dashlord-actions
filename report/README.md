## Add a new column

To add a new column in the dashboard, you have to follow these steps (cf. [Pull Request to add the SE current phase](https://github.com/SocialGouv/dashlord-actions/pull/172)):

1. Make sure the required info to displayed is stored in `report.json`. For instance, the SE current phase is stored in the `betagouv` key.
2. Create a summary extractor for your value. It will add the values that you specify to the summary key in the `report.json`. These values will then be accessible in the dashboard tab. For instance, we created a `betagouv.js` file, that extracts the SE current phase from the `betagouv` key
3. Add a key to your `dashbord.yml` to enable the feature you want to use. For instance, we added `betagouv`.
4. Add in `www/src/components/Dashboard.tsx` the column using the `getColumn` function
5. Add in `www/src/components/Url.tsx` the panel you want to display in the corresponding tab.

## Dev

- A first step is to build a light index of latest scans in `www/src/report.json`. this is done by [`./src/index.js`](./src/index.js).
- The report website itself live in the `www` folder.

```sh
cd www
yarn
yarn start
```

ðŸ’¡ To work with fresh data, get the `report` artifact from some of your `Build website` dashlord job.
